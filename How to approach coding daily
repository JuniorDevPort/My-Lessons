Just to be clear, Iâ€™m not suggesting that you only work four hours a day. The other four hours are usually best spent:


Researching, both work-related and non-work related topics
Discussing your work with a colleague
Helping coworkers who are struggling with their own work
Planning your future work
Code Reviews
Meetings
