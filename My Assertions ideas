So i'm pondering how to write some TDD.
Tdd might mean console.log(1 === 1) or console.log(value range == value range)

I am trying to think of working principles of values and coercive(abstractions) assertion and strict assertion(type and value).

Is this okay or not?
x = 75;

console.log((100 > x && x > 10) == true) => This came out : true

console.log((100 > x && x > 10) === true) => This came out : true

console.log((100 > x > 10) == true) => This came out : false

console.log((100 > x > 10) === true) => This came out : false

Interistingly:

console.log(((100 > x && x > 10) == (100 > x && x > 10)) == true) => true

and

console.log(((100 > x && x > 10) == (100 > x && x > 10)) === true) => true

From this point on forward Testing should be an easy endevour.

TDD - would mean i write the assertion, get a console log of false. and can then test output.

Ofc. i could try to run a group of these assertions and then log directrlyninto a bug tracker/logger?
