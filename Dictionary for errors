Here we see an example of a test case where we test for undefined, if we get an undefined result, then this is an error.

-->
function myFunction() {
  var x;

  if (typeof x === "undefined") {
    txt = "x is undefined";
  } else {
    txt = "x is defined";
  }
  
  function myFunction() {
  var x;

  if  true ===(typeof x,"undefined") {
    txt = "x is undefined";
  } else {
    txt = "x is defined";
  }
  
  <!--       

I want to do another one assertion, its about Stack tracing.

Debugger functionality: 

- find ananymous functions;
- find the line an error code was given
- run through each step and log th number of steps and the lines it is happening in the code,


Use this to create error dictionary
-->

var dict = {
  FirstName: "Chris",
  "one": 1,
  1: "some value"
};
